      \n\nKey Benefits:
      \n- Pre-project estimating
      \n- Designing around existing features
      \n- Engineering and coordination
      \n- Construction monitoring
      \n- As-built verification
      \n- Facility management
      \n\nWith high-end laser scanners achieving accuracy within 1/8â€³ over 100 ft or more, this service ensures true conditions are shown, reducing costly design and construction errors. The model can include essential items such as floors, walls, ceilings, doors, piping, equipment, lights, building exteriors, and more, keeping budget and manageability in mind.
